## **Name**: 
Bounty0x proposal 1 - New Bounties

## **Purpose**: 
The purpose of this proposal is to enable DNT holders to stake DNT and participate in Bounty0x governance by staking for option 1 or 2.

Which type of bounties should Bounty0x add to itâ€™s platform next? 

Option 1: Research Bounties - Incentivizing Universities and Governments to post bounties for incentivizing the completion of specific goals, like finding the cure for a certain type of diseases or cancer. 

Option 2: Corporations strategy bounties - Incentivizing consultants to suggest strategies for increasing revenue

## **Description**: 
Bounty0x is a decentralized bounty platform which makes use of the district0x voting dapp to allow the community to determine a variety of governance issues on the bounty0x network. 

To signal for your vote, please complete the following steps:


1. Enable the MetaMask or Parity extension in your browser 
2. Fund your MetaMask or Parity wallet with district0x Network Tokens
3. Click 'Vote' under the decision you would like to signal for.
4. Confirm the transaction via MetaMask or Parity extension
5. If you want to vote from MyEtherWallet, see tutorial here

Note: You may only vote for one district per address at a time. No DNT are transferred when signaling, the voting mechanism simply registers your indication to your address. As such, the entire DNT balance stored at that address would be counted towards the vote. Once DNT is transferred to a new address, the district's vote total would be lowered by a corresponding amount. Your vote can be changed at any time by voting again from the same address.


## **Ethereum Address**:
Be sure it is an ethereum address that you control the private key to, tokens sent to an exchange will be lost.
